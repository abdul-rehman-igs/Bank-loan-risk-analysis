## 📘 Project Overview
This project aims to predict **loan applicant risk** (High vs. Low) using applicant data such as **income, age, credit score, loan amount**, and other financial indicators.  
We build a **classification model in R** and then visualize insights through an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.
